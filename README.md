This is a responsive e-commerce product listing page using React.js. The page
should fetch product data from the FakeStoreAPI, display the products in a grid or list view, and
include functionalities for searching, filtering, and sorting the products.

I wanted to use Redux toolkit but seeing as the components were not much i decided to use the usestate hook for state management.
I used tailwind css for design. A toggle animation switch for list and grid view.

Unit Tests was done using Jest/React test Libraries.

To Run project
npm install on terminal

To Start
npm run dev.
